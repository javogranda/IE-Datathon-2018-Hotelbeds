#  Winner Project of The Final Datathon Challenge for the 2018 Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics in IE University

Final Datathon for the Masters in Big Data and Business Analytics. The goal was to detect pricing anomalies in hotel contracts given a hotel bookings dataset (1M rows). This is a relevant business case for HotelBeds Group because errors within these contracts can negatively impact revenue due to incorrect pricing.

I worked alongside an amazing team and after running an EDA and feature engineering process on the data we developed a hybrid and assembled approach. Using rule-based, machine learning (one-class SVM, isolation forests, KNN regressor) and deep learning (recurrent neural nets) techniques we were able to accurately detect anomalies with an accuracy of 65.75%.
